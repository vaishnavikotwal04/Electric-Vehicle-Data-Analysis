# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis

## Problem Statement
The objective is to analyze the adoption and growth of electric vehicles (EVs) by assessing key metrics, trends, and market patterns. This analysis will focus on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding technology advancements, policy-making, and market strategies.

## Specific Goals:
#### 1. Market Size and Growth Analysis:

Assess the total number of EVs (BEVs and PHEVs) to understand the overall market landscape.
Evaluate the growth trends from 2010 onwards to gauge adoption over time.

#### 2. Technological Advancements:

Calculate the average electric range of EVs to understand progress in technology and efficiency.
#### 3. Segmentation of BEVs and PHEVs:

Identify the total number of BEVs and PHEVs and calculate their respective percentages within the EV market.
Analyze the dominance of fully electric models versus hybrid models.

#### 4. Geographical and Manufacturer Insights:

Analyze EV distribution by state to identify regions with higher adoption rates.
Identify the top 10 EV manufacturers and models to evaluate market dominance and consumer preferences.

#### 5. Impact of Incentives:

Determine the proportion of EVs eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives to understand the effectiveness of policy measures in driving adoption.

## Deliverables:
### Data Visualizations:
